# Travel Company Email

## About the project

This is my first HTML Email project. All the CSS is inline and HTML tables have been used to structure the email.
testing was done on PutsMail.

## What I learned

This being my first HTML Email project I learned about the importance of why tables are used and improved 
my ability to work with them.

I also learned about the importance of creating alternatives for images as not all email clients load images.

This was also my first time testing HTML Emails using PutsMail.
